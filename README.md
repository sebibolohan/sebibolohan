<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Bolohan Constantin-Sebastian</h1>

### 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science student from "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University, deeply interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Databases**.  
I enjoy exploring a wide range of technical challenges — from building smart applications that recognize flowers, to designing compilers and interactive AR environments.  
I'm a fast learner, always open to feedback, and I truly value working in **collaborative, team-oriented environments** where knowledge is shared and innovation thrives.

💡 My goal is to combine creativity, structure, and data to create tools that are both useful and impactful.

### 📂 Projects (Selection)
- 🌺 **Flower Recognition App (Bachelor Thesis)** – A mobile AR application developed in Unity that recognizes flowers using a TensorFlow Lite model trained on the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset. The app combines real-time image classification with Firebase authentication and a Gemini-powered chatbot to display interactive botanical information in augmented reality. Developed as part of my final year thesis.
- 🧠 **Catalog AI** – an app that classifies types of bread using a custom-trained neural network and natural language input, developed for an AI university course.
- 🎮 **FIIBurgeria** – interactive VR experience in Unity simulating a fast-food restaurant, allowing users to play the role of a cook and interact with customers (Mixed Reality).
- 💻 **Meeting Scheduler** – GUI desktop app in Python using Tkinter that lets users manage meetings by date, time and participants.
- 🚘 **Traffic Monitor** – C++ client-server app for simulating live traffic and reporting incidents.
- 🧾 **BibMat** – C++ console tool that performs advanced matrix operations with user-friendly logic.
